# My friend John and I are members of the "Fat to Fit Club (FFC)". John is worried because each month a list with the weights of members is published and each month he is the last on the list which means he is the heaviest.

# I am the one who establishes the list so I told him: "Don't worry any more, I will modify the order of the list". It was decided to attribute a "weight" to numbers. The weight of a number will be from now on the sum of its digits.

# For example 99 will have "weight" 18, 100 will have "weight" 1 so in the list 100 will come before 99.

# Given a string with the weights of FFC members in normal order can you give this string ordered by "weights" of these numbers?
